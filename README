pylabels
========

pylabels is a Python library for creating PDFs to print sheets of labels. It
uses the ReportLab PDF toolkit to produce the PDF.

Basically, the user creates a set of specifications of the label sizes etc,
writes a callback function which does the actual drawing, and gives these two
items to a Sheet object along with an output filename. Items are then added to
the sheet using the add_label() method (or add_labels() to add all items from
an iterable).

The callback function is called once for each item, being given a ReportLab
Drawing object representing the label, its width and height, and the item to
draw on the label. Any of the standard ReportLab drawing methods can be used,
with pylabels automatically adding a clipping path around each label to prevent
it interfering with other labels.

Examples
========

The following examples are available in the demos directory:

* basic.py - a introduction to the basic use of pylabels.
* partial_page.py - how to produce partial pages (i.e., pages with some of the
                    labels previously used).
* nametags.py - creates a set of nametags from the list of names in the
                names.txt file. Includes the use of two custom fonts, font size
                selection, and centred text.
